## Highlights

### ⚡ Battery Current Anomaly Detection (TranAD)
**TranAD · PyTorch · Pandas**  
Detected irregular current patterns in high-frequency signals.  
✅ Replaced 2 manual inspectors, saving ¥104,000/year.

### 🖥️ Model Evaluation Assistant  
**PyQt · Pandas**  
Built GUI tool for FP/FN/TP/TN tagging with batch processing and CSV export.  
📈 85% faster validation during model tuning.

---

### 📡 Real-Time Defect Diagnosis System  
**PyQt · NumPy · Matplotlib**  
Client-server setup across 20+ machines for instant defect log parsing and alerting.  
⏱️ Reduced diagnosis time from 24h to 2h.
